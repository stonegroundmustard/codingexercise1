# Coding Exercise Basics

## File Structure

  File structure can seem daunting at first but it is extremely important for linking and organization. For this exercise your file structure should look like this:
  <insert screenshot of file structure here>
  
 ## File named 'index.html'
  
    This is your HTML page, the basic content and paramaters of your web page. Below is considered the MVP (minimum viable product) of what you HTML page needs as a setup. 
  
                                                          <!DOCTYPE html>
                                                        <html>
                                                        <meta charset="UTF-8">
                                                        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
                                                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/3/w3.css">
                                                        <body>

                                                        <!-- Content will go here -->

                                                        </body>
                                                        </html>
  ## Fleshing It Out
  
    To give this skeleton a bit of life, we will add some very minor html & css styling. The stylings add will be: header, navigation bar, main content, side content, and a footer. I will be publishing these bits in the Develop file folders. Be sure to play around with the sizing and colors so you can see the difference!
