 ## File named 'index.html'
  
    This is your HTML page, the basic content and paramaters of your web page. Below is considered the MVP (minimum viable product) of what you HTML page needs as a setup. 
  
                                                          <!DOCTYPE html>
                                                        <html>
                                                        <meta charset="UTF-8">
                                                        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
                                                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/3/w3.css">
                                                        <body>

                                                        <!-- Content will go here -->

                                                        </body>
                                                        </html>
